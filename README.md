# THREE.snake

The game is a two player variant of a classic snake game which takes place on a 3-D surface (eg. a sphere, a torus, a mobius strip) instead of on a plane. As with all snake games, eating stuff on the map will allow the snake to grow in length. In addition, causing the other player to bump into your snake will cause the theirs to shorten and yours to grow (so players should try to trap each other) - the longer snake at the end of the game wins.

## Structure
### index.html
The landing page is generated by github's page generator and serves as an entrance to the project.

### THREE.Snake.html
This is the main page for the game. Currently it still shows the animation assingment. It will soon be replaced by actual content.

## Development

The starting code is adopted from [COS426 Assignment 4](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring15/cos426/assign4/). Please push directly to the branch gh-pages for now so that the results are immediately visible on [github.io](http://dxue2012.github.io/THREE.snake
).
