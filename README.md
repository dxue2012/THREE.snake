# THREE.snake

The game is a two player variant of a classic snake game which takes place on a 3-D surface (eg. a sphere, a torus, a mobius strip) instead of on a plane. As with all snake games, eating stuff on the map will allow the snake to grow in length. In addition, causing the other player to bump into your snake will cause the theirs to shorten and yours to grow (so players should try to trap each other) - the longer snake at the end of the game wins.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. Change to the subdirectory THREE.snake
3. Switch branch to gh-pages
4. Launch a web server on your computer, rooted at this directory

```
git clone https://github.com/dxue2012/THREE.snake.git
cd THREE.snake
git checkout gh-pages
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Once you have started the local web server, direct your browser to http://localhost:8000. You should see the landing page.

## Structure
### index.html
The landing page is generated by github's page generator and serves as an entrance to the project.

### THREE.Snake.html
This is the main page for the game. Currently it still shows the animation assingment. It will soon be replaced by actual content.

## Development

Our starting code is adopted from [COS426 Assignment 4](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring15/cos426/assign4/). Please push directly to the branch gh-pages for now so that the results are immediately visible on [github.io](http://dxue2012.github.io/THREE.snake).

### Setting Up TypeScript
We prefer [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) over JavaScript for its better type system (Well to be fair, JavaScript has no types...). A really cool plugin called **TSD** allows us to install typings from project [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/tsd), from which we retrieve typings for existing 3rd-party librarys such as **THREE.js**. To setup your dev environment, follow the instructions on their [home page](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/tsd) and then run

```
tsd reinstall
```

This re-installs (or if it is the first time, just installs) the definitions listed in `tsd.json` to the folder `typings/`. Note that `typings/` is ignored by `.gitignore` so that it doesn't clutter our repo.
